// This macro holds an monotonic increasing value, which indicates
//    a specific fix/patch is present on trunk.  This value isn't related to
//    minor/major version-macros.  It is increased on demand, if a big
//    fix was applied to trunk.  This macro gets just increased on trunk.  For
//    other branches its value won't be modified.

// mingw.org's version macros: these make gcc to define
//    MINGW32_SUPPORTS_MT_EH and to use the _CRT_MT global
//    and the __mingwthr_key_dtor() function from the MinGW
//    CRT in its private gthr-win32.h header.

// Set VC specific compiler target macros.

// MS does not prefix symbols by underscores for 64-bit.
// As we have to support older gcc version, which are using underscores
//       as symbol prefix for x64, we have to check here for the user label
//       prefix defined by gcc.

// Special case nameless struct/union.

// MinGW-w64 has some additional C99 printf/scanf feature support.
//    So we add some helper macros to ease recognition of them.

// fallback on default implementation if we can't know the size of the destination

// Include _cygwin.h if we're building a Cygwin application.

// Target specific macro replacement for type "long".  In the Windows API,
//    the type long is always 32 bit, even if the target is 64 bit (LLP64).
//    On 64 bit Cygwin, the type long is 64 bit (LP64).  So, to get the right
//    sized definitions and declarations, all usage of type long in the Windows
//    headers have to be replaced by the below defined macro __LONG32.

// C/C++ specific language defines.

// Note the extern. This is needed to work around GCC's
// limitations in handling dllimport attribute.

// Attribute `nonnull' was valid as of gcc 3.3.  We don't use GCC's
//    variadiac macro facility, because variadic macros cause syntax
//    errors with  --traditional-cpp.
